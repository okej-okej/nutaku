The first is the creation of adult gaming experience under the JNT Games subbrand,
in cooperation with the Nutaku Publishing platform. The second segment of the Company's activity is
creating AA segment games available to all players, mainly thanks to such
platforms as Steam, Epic Games Store and console platforms.

Development prospects
INTERMARUM S.A. in 2023 will continue the development strategy adopted
by the Management Board on January 8, 2021. The main assumption of the strategy is to create
a significant Company on the Gamedev industry market in Poland, capable of competing with leading
game producers, ready to acquire and develop unique competences in the field of
game production and the use of augmented reality (AR - Augmented Reality).

In 2023, the studio's key production will be the game Shelter 69, which was released in
May 2022. Further work on the game, its systematic development and new content will allow
to keep players in production and stabilize revenue at a very good level.

In 2023, the Company plans to continue its work on the Orange.2, Pink.2 and
Pink.3 games, including primarily searching for global publishers for them. Unfortunately,
the uncertain situation in the global economy, rising inflation and the war in Ukraine have had a strong impact
on the Gamedev industry, especially in terms of investing in new projects. In 2023,
one can notice growing caution on the part of global publishers regarding
financing subsequent productions. This is mainly due to waiting for the direction that
the global economy will take and affects the extension of the decision-making process and postponement
of deadlines. Therefore, despite the positive reception among publishers of Orange.2 and
Pink.2 games, decisions on their financing have been postponed. This extended waiting period forced the Company to reduce employment in the Orange.2 team.

At the same time, the Company maintains a team of employees who are key to the further development of this
game, capable of quickly rebuilding production capabilities with intensive recruitment, in the
situation of signing publishing agreements for Orange.2 or Pink.2.

In the opinion of the Management Board, June

2023 will be key for finding publishers for these games. At the same time, the Management Board emphasizes that problems with finding publishers will

translate to the release date of the Orange.2 game, which was to reach players this year. The Company will inform about the new

publishing schedule once the publishing agreement has been signed.

In 2023, the VR version of the Workshop Simulator game will be developed in cooperation with VR Factory Games SA. Work on porting the game to VR devices is progressing according to

schedule. The game is also planned to premiere in the Epic Games
Store soon.
